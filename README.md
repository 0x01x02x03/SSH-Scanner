# SSH-Scanner
Brute Force tool to get access to server through port 22 (IPv4). User and password are chosen from the list of common User/Pass

All files require pexpect which is a python lib for Unix, there is also a Win version called Winpexpect but its so buggy.

Simplescan.py => very simple scan, i used as my test file
